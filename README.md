# mess-of-linux-configurations

Just bunch of different configs and scripts, which I use for my desktop. 

Directory bin contains different scripts for managing multiply monitors, installing/removing groups of packages on Arch-based systems and etc.

Directory etc contains mainly configs for sway, zsh and p10k powerlevel

Directory src contains sources for my monitoring tools written mostly in Go. Some of them aren't universal and contain hardcoded paths
